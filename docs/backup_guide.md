# 🛡️ TFI Music Project Backup Guide

**GOOD NEWS!** I have simplified the backup process for you.

## ✅ The Only Step You Need
You only need to back up **ONE folder**:

*   **Source**: `C:\Users\justi\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\tfi-music`
*   **Action**: Copy this entire folder to your external drive or USB.

That's it!

### Why?
I have already copied all the important context files (the "brain") into a new `docs/` folder inside your project. So everything—code, sounds, and planning—is now in one place.

## 🚀 How to Restore After Reinstalling

When you are back on your fresh Windows:

1.  **Install Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Restore Folder**: Copy your `tfi-music` folder back to your computer.
3.  **Start Coding**:
    *   Open Terminal in that folder.
    *   Run `npm install`.
    *   Run `npm run dev`.
4.  **Tell the AI**: "I am continuing development. Please check the `docs/project_context.md` file."

Good luck! 💻🔄
