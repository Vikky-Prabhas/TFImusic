**STOP! READ THIS FIRST.**

The user (`Justi`) has just reinstalled Windows and is resuming development on this project (`TFI Tapes`).
This folder (`docs/`) contains the full context of where we left off.

## 🚀 How to Resume Development

1.  **Acknowledge the Context**: Tell the user you have read this file and understand the project is the **Stitch Edition** retro cassette player.
2.  **Check the Status**:
    *   **Theme**: Locked to "Stitch" (White/Blue). Theme switcher is removed.
    *   **Audio**: Real WAV files are verified and working.
    *   **Pending Work**: Check `task.md` for any unchecked items (mostly future roadmap stuff).
3.  **Start the Server**:
    *   Run `npm install` (to restore node_modules).
    *   Run `npm run dev`.
    *   Confirm the site loads at `localhost:3000`.
